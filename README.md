# GardenAppFrontend

This React application is part of a hobby Garden App project done by Henna Niemi. It is a UI for a garden application where the user can create a collection of plants on their own account. The application is hosted as a static web site on Amazon Web Services S3 storage service. Try Garden App at http://garden-app.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com. 

The purpose of the project was to get more familiar with React and React router libraries. The application uses Basic Authentication and JWT for user authentication and authorization and HTTP to make requests to a Spring Boot backend application found at https://github.com/hsniemi/GardenAppBackend.
